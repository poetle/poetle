Thank you for stopping by!

I'm Jackie, an incoming graduate student studying digital signal processing in relation to medical brain imaging.

Some of my projects included:
  1. Sleep state estimation with spatiotemporal EEG segmentation
  2. Heart rate monitoring via circuit design and signal analysis
  4. Protein propagation modeling in Parkinson's Disease
  5. Wearable device for hand tremor characterization
  6. Post-cardiac arrest recovery prediction using ML classification and HPC

My portfolio page is a work in progress at the moment, but feel free to look around!
