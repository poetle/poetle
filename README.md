Thank you for stopping by!

I'm Jackie, an incoming graduate student studying digital signal processing in relation to medical brain imaging.


Some of my projects include:
  1. Sleep state estimation by spatiotemporal EEG segmentation
  2. Heart rate monitoring via circuit design and ECG processing
  4. Protein propagation modeling in Parkinson's Disease
  5. Wearable device for hand tremor characterization
  6. Neurologic CA prognosis using ML classification and HPC


I code mainly in MATLAB, Python, and R, but am learning SQL, C++, and Julia.

My portfolio page is a work in progress at the moment, but feel free to look around!
