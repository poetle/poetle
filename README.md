Thank you for stopping by!

I'm Jackie, a data analyst at MGH CNTR developing ML pipelines to draw predictions across patient data. This comprises EEG, EHR, and ECG along with telemetry waveforms and medical imaging modalities for improved clinical decision-making in critical care.

My current interests lie in digital signal processing and MRI, including ML implementations in these areas.

Some of my past projects include:
  >1. Sleep state estimation by spatiotemporal EEG segmentation
  >2. Heart rate monitoring via PPG circuit design and ECG analysis
  >3. Protein propagation modeling in Parkinson's Disease
  >4. Wearable device for hand tremor characterization
  >5. Neuroprognostication of CA using ML classification and HPC
  >6. Wordle gameplay on a portable embedded system

I code mainly in MATLAB, Python, and R, but am learning SQL, C++, and Julia. I've recently been really interested in DevOps.

Feel free to look around!
