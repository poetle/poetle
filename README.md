Thank you for stopping by!

I'm Jackie, an incoming graduate student studying digital signal processing in relation to medical brain imaging. Currently working as a data analyst at MGH CNTR developing pipelines to process patient waveform data, such as EEG, EHR, and telemetry for improved clinical decisionmaking.


Some of my past projects include:
  >1. Sleep state estimation by spatiotemporal EEG segmentation
  >2. Heart rate monitoring via circuit design and ECG analysis
  >3. Protein propagation modeling in Parkinson's Disease
  >4. Wearable device for hand tremor characterization
  >5. Neurologic CA prognosis using ML classification and HPC batch processing
  >6. Wordle gameplay on a portable embedded system


I code mainly in MATLAB, Python, and R, but am learning SQL, C++, and Julia.

Have recently been really interested in DevOps as a whole.

My portfolio page is a work in progress at the moment, but feel free to look around!
